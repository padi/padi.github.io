Marc/Rendl/Padi/Jaci/(suggest a new nick here) is a graduate of Mathematics at the University of the Philippines, Diliman.
I'm a freelance web developer with 10+ yrs. of combined experience in Ruby on Rails and Digital Marketing (FB and FB Messenger Automation). 

I've made/maintained [web apps]({{ site.url }}/articles/web-apps-vs-websites/) for [aelogica](http://aelogica.com) and [TrafficDito.com](https://trafficdito.com) in various industries:

- eCommerce (custom platform, Shopify Apps)
- Health and Fitness
- Real Estate, Self-storage, Senior Living
- Digital Marketing
- Golf
- An Australian book and TV Show

And I am open to take on more ecommerce/Shopify-related projects.

## Better Every Day is all about:

* Web development, mostly related to [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) and [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).
* Tips to be better than yesterday...  what worked for me and what didn't.
