Oftentimes, people ask me what I do for a living.
And when they do, I always try to convey it
in the simplest, least alienating way possible. So far,
my standard response is: "I make **web apps**." And they'd usually
reply: "Ah, so you make **websites**?" Well, kind of, but not quite.

#### So what's the difference?

In a gist: **websites** contain *static* content, while **web apps** are *dynamic*.

You can think of *static* websites similar to a brochure: it usually publishes
a small amount of information that rarely changes, like information
about a nearby restaurant.

On the other hand, *dynamic* web apps are pretty much like your smartphone
or desktop application: they often serve and change large amounts
of information in short span of time. Web applications usually
rely on you, the user, to interact with them to produce some
useful output. A good example would be Twitter, of which changes
to content are directly influenced by other users by the second.

So that's it. Simple isn't it?
